<!-- Explanations:
1. vh Represents a percentage of the height of the viewport's
2. animation: heartbeat 1s infinite; → Applies an animation called heartbeat that lasts 1 second and repeats forever.
3. @keyframes is a CSS rule used to define animations. The heartbeat animation creates a smooth pulsing effect (like a real heartbeat) by changing the size of an element over time.
4. ease-in-out means it will fade in smoothly over 0.5 seconds instead of appearing suddenly.
5. The + symbol in CSS is called the Adjacent Sibling Selector. Only selects the first .hidden-message immediately after .heart. When you hover over the heart (❤️), the hidden message appears!
Stops showing when you move your mouse away.
If use nothing in between, doesn't show message.
if use comma, shows message even without hovering.
